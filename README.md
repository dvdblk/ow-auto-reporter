# Auto Reporter for Overwatch 2
Automatically reports a hovered player for selected reasons.

Features:
  * Customizable report reasons
  * Works with all window sizes (in-game resolutions)

## Installation

Install [tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) first. Then:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the `run.bat` script (or create a shortcut for it).
3. Go to Overwatch and press `CTRL+SHIFT+R` on a hovered player.

## Limitations

* No option to stop the report process (takes control of the mouse movements for a few seconds)
